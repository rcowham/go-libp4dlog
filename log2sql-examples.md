# log2sql example SQL statements

These are examples of queries that might be interesting to run against
a database created by the log2sql scripts.

`log2sql` automatically creates a Sqlite3 database from a log which can be reported on via these SQL queries.

You need to install sqlite3 to be able to view (with apt-get/yum as appropriate on Linux).

Many of these queries have been automated in the Bash script provided as part of this project: [sql_report.sh](cmd/log2sql/sql_report.sh)

Once installed, you can quickly view some results with commands like this:

```
sqlite3 -header run.db <<EOF
.mode column
SELECT cmd, count(cmd) as num_cmds
FROM process 
ORDER by num_cmds;
EOF
```

Please note, in the SQL statements below, there are sometimes 2 versions - this is because
Sqlite syntax needs "SUBSTR" not "SUBSTRING" (used by mysql and other DBMSs).
